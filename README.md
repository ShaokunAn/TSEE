# TSEE
An elastic embedding method to visualize the dynamic gene expression patterns of time series single-cell RNA sequencing data

This repository contains an implementation of the TSEE algorithm described in ["TSEE: an elastic embedding method to visualize the dynamic gene expression patterns of time series single-cell RNA sequencing data"](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-5477-8). TSEE is a nonliner dimensionality reduction and visualization algorithm to handle time series high-dimensional data. It incorporates temporal information of each sample with the high-dimensional data. We applied TSES to time series single-cell RNA-sequencing data, demonstrating its superioty in preserving both local and global topological structure hidden in high-dimensional data, as well as maintaning the temoporal structure/order based on the addition temporal information.
